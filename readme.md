# ASMCalc

## What's this?

A WIP calculator app, designed as a learning project to implement parsing, math operations etc in AARCH64 assembly.

## Can I use this?
Of course! This is supposed to run on MacOS and Linux. Windows is not supported at the time ( who even uses windows on arm? )

## Will this break my computer?
Maybe, maybe not. I've tested the code on MacOS and Ubuntu ARM, and it seems stable, however, as I'm a beginner, no guarantees can be made
