# ASMCalc

## General architecture
* ASMCalc is spread out amongst a few files. These are: 
    * main.s: contains the main program
    * strlen.s: contains an own implementation of the strlen function
    * macros.s : contains useful macros
    * io.s    : macros to read and write to console, as well as functions to do that.
